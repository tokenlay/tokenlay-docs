# Introduction

**Tokenlay** is a drop-in proxy that gives you complete control over AI usage and costs. Track spending per user, enforce rate limits, and automatically route to cheaper models based on smart rules — all without changing your existing OpenAI code. Get started with just a few lines of code using your preferred language.

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Tokenlay uses a bring-your-own-key model where you maintain complete control of your AI provider credentials.

- **Your keys, your data** — Your API keys stay under your control. Tokenlay acts as a transparent proxy without storing credentials.
- **No lock-in** — Switch away anytime since you own the underlying API keys and usage data.
- **Free to use** — Tokenlay is completely free. You pay providers directly at standard rates with no markup.
- **Compatible with all major providers** — Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, and more.
